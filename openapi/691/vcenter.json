In this way, the client will only receive notification from that specified object changes. There is no limit on how many subscription an endpoint can add. B. In the second case, the client makes a subscription without a specified VCTrust object, which means the client is interested in every VCTrust object. Whenever the database changes (e.g add a new VCTrust, delete VCTrust, update...), the client gets notified. All the records in the database will not be deleted automatically.
